# Credits

I’m not working alone on this project. First, many people create PR for this
projects. Then, there is the whole #pinetime community : a lot of people all
around the world who are hacking, searching, experimenting and programming the
Pinetime. We exchange our ideas, experiments and code in the chat rooms and
forums.

Here are some people I would like to highlight:

 - [Atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441/) : He works on an Arduino based
   firmware for the Pinetime and many other smartwatches based on similar
   hardware. He was of great help when I was implementing support for the BMA421
   motion sensor and I²C driver.
 - [Koen](https://github.com/bosmoment) : He’s working on a firmware based on
   RiotOS. He integrated similar libs as me : NimBLE, LittleVGL,… His help was
   invaluable too!
 - [Lup Yuen Lee](https://github.com/lupyuen) : He is everywhere: he works on a
   Rust firmware, builds a MCUBoot based bootloader for the Pinetime, designs a
   Flutter based companion app for smartphones and writes a lot of articles
   about the Pinetime!
